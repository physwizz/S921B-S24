	  Selecting this option enables workaround for SoC emulators like
	  Palladium and ZeBu. They emulate a lot of components of SoC but
	  are missing some components that causes serious performance impact.
	  The time in the emulators is also very different from the time in
	  silicon. Select this option if you are compiling for ZeBu or
	  Palladium.

	  AFM is Adaptive Frequency Manager. PMIC assert AFM_WARN signal when
	  over-current situation is detected. HTU_G3D receives this signal
	  and makes interrupt notifying over-currency to KMD. GPU DVFS need to
	  down the GPU frequency for ensuring GPU stability.

	  interrupt is occurred.

	help
	  If GPU does have memory coherent with the host CPUs, GPU drivers
	  should make sure the GPU bufffers shared with CPU are coherent.
	  The cost of extra SW overhead for memory coherency can be significant
	  while the latency of an access to write-combining memory is dramatically
	  slow. Set n if PAL is able to handle all memory coherency for cacheable
	  buffer objects and performance impact of SW overhead for memory coherency
	  is neglectable.
